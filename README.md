# Sad update
This project was mainly made by myself when I was working at Vilnius University. 
It had much attention from all of You - and You have my sincere `thank You!` for that. 
It had loads of implementations in learning facilities, also some of them featured in
enterprise solutions.
Having said that, I'm sorry to say, that due to the politics of Vilnius University, I had to resign
and discontinue developing this awesome OpenSource VDI solution. 
Vilnius University decided to go fully closed source and I switched my job to continue
to work on different projects.
I truly hope that this was a beginning of an OpenSource VDi solution that
will be continued.
I will still try support all of the current users. But that is all.
Sorry for all of You, who made contributions or are using `KVM-VDI`
